   - Alternatively, use the shortcut `Ctrl+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+N` (Mac).

3. **Enter Data**
   - Click on a cell and start typing to enter data.
   - Use the `Tab` key to move to the next cell or `Enter` to move down to the cell below.

   - Choose a location, enter a file name, and select "Excel Workbook (*.xlsx)" as the file format.
   - Click "Save".

6. **Apply Formulas and Functions**
   - In an empty cell, enter a formula (e.g., `=SUM(A1:A10)` to sum the values in cells A1 to A10).
   - Press `Enter` to calculate the result.
   - Use functions like `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `IF`, etc., by typing `=` followed by the function name and arguments.

7. **Create Charts**

#### Supporting Concepts and Information:

- **Cells, Rows, and Columns**: Understand that Excel is organized into cells, which are the intersections of rows and columns. Each cell has a unique address (e.g., A1, B2).

- **Ranges**: A range is a selection of cells, such as A1:C3, which includes all cells from A1 to C3.

- **Functions and Formulas**: Functions are built-in formulas that perform calculations on data. Formulas can be created using cell references, constants, and functions.

- **Absolute and Relative References**: An absolute reference (e.g., `$A$1`) doesn't change when copied to another cell. A relative reference (e.g., `A1`) changes based on the new cell's position.

- **Formatting**: Formatting can enhance readability and convey meaning. Apply number formats, conditional formatting, and styles to make your data more understandable.

- **Charts and Graphs**: Charts and graphs help visualize data trends and patterns. Choose the right chart type based on your data and intended message.

- **Data Validation**: Use data validation to control what data can be entered in cells. For example, you can create a drop-down list of allowed values.

- **Collaboration**: Excel allows multiple users to work on a workbook simultaneously. Share workbooks using OneDrive, SharePoint, or other cloud services.

- **Macros**: Macros are custom scripts that automate tasks. Use the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor to create and manage macros.

By following these tasks and understanding the supporting concepts, you'll be able to use Microsoft Excel efficiently for data analysis, reporting, and more.
