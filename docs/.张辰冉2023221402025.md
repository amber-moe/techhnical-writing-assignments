# Technical Documentation: For Loops in Python

## Introduction

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive guide on `for` loops in Python. `For` loops are essential constructs in programming, enabling the repetition of a block of code over a sequence of items. This document covers the syntax, usage, common examples, and advanced concepts related to `for` loops.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into `for` loops, ensure you have a basic understanding of:

- Variables
- Data types (integers, strings, lists, etc.)
- Basic Python syntax and indentation

## What is a `for` Loop?

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

### Basic Syntax

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each item
```

- `item`: A variable that takes the value of the current element in the sequence.
- `sequence`: The collection of items you want to iterate over.

## Examples

### Example 1: Iterating Over a List

Let's start with a simple example. Suppose you have a list of fruits, and you want to print each fruit.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output:**

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

### Example 2: Iterating Over a Range

You can also use the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers. This is useful when you want to repeat an action a specific number of times.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. `range()` Function

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers. It can take one, two, or three arguments:

- `range(stop)`: Generates numbers from 0 to `stop-1`.
- `range(start, stop)`: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop-1`.
- `range(start, stop, step)`: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop-1`, incrementing by `step`.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
2
4
6
8
```

### 2. `break` and `continue` Statements

- `break`: Exits the loop prematurely.
- `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
```

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
4
```

### 3. Nested `for` Loops

A nested `for` loop is a loop inside another loop. This is useful for iterating over multi-dimensional sequences like lists of lists.

**Example:**

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

for row in matrix:
    for number in row:
        print(number, end=" ")
    print()
```

**Output:**

```
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
```

### 4. Using `enumerate()`

The `enumerate()` function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object. This is useful when you need both the index and the value of each item.

**Example:**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")
```

**Output:**

```
Index 0: apple
Index 1: banana
Index 2: cherry
```

## Conclusion

`For` loops are a powerful tool in Python, allowing you to automate repetitive tasks and process collections of data efficiently. By understanding the basics and practicing with examples, you'll be well on your way to mastering this essential programming concept.
