# For Loop in Python

## I. Introduction

The `for` loop in Python helps us do repetitive tasks. For new Python programmers, understanding it is key to more complex programming.

## II. Basic Concepts

### (I) Need for `for` Loop

To print 100 numbers from 1 to 100 without a loop, we need 100 `print` statements. This is slow. The `for` loop does this task quickly.

### (II) Iterable Objects

We must know iterable objects first. In Python, an iterable object has multiple elements we can access one by one.

1. **List**
    - A list in Python uses `[]`. Elements can be any data type, like `my_list = [1, 'apple', 3.14]`.
2. **Tuple**
    - A tuple is like a list but can't change after creation. Use `()`, like `my_tuple=(1, 2, 3)`.
3. **String**
    - A string is a set of characters. In Python, it's an iterable object, like `my_string = "hello"`.
4. **Range Object**
    - The `range` object shows a sequence of integers. For example, `range(5)` is 0 to 4. We can set start, end, and step values, like `range(1, 10, 2)` which is 1 to 9 with step 2.

## III. Basic Syntax

The Python `for` loop syntax is:

```python
for variable in iterable_object:
    statement1
    statement2
```

1. **Variable**
    - This stores elements from the iterable object in each loop. Name it following Python rules, like `item`, `element`, or `num`.
2. **Iterable Object**
    - This has multiple elements like lists, tuples, strings, or range objects.
3. **Loop Body**
    - Statements here run once for each element in the iterable object. For example:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Here, `fruits` is the iterable object (a list), and `fruit` is the variable. Each loop gives `fruit` a value from the list and prints it.

## IV. Examples

### (I) Traversing Lists

1. **Simple Traversal**
    - If we have a list of student names, we can print each name.

```python
students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
for student in students:
    print(student)
```

2. **Calculations during Traversal**
    - For a list of numbers, we can find and print their squares.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    square = number * number
    print(f"The square of {number} is {square}")
```

### (II) Traversing Tuples

- Traversing a tuple is like traversing a list.

```python
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)
for coordinate in coordinates:
    print(coordinate)
```

### (III) Traversing Strings

- When traversing a string, we process each character.

```python
message = "Python is fun"
for char in message:
    print(char)
```

### (IV) Using `range` Objects

1. **Simple Use**
    - Print numbers from 0 to 9.

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

2. **Specifying Values**
    - Print odd numbers from 1 to 10.

```python
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(i)
```

## V. Nested `for` Loops

### (I) Concept

A nested `for` loop has one `for` loop inside another. It helps with multi - dimensional data structures like two - dimensional lists.

### (II) Example: Two - Dimensional Lists

- If we have a two - dimensional list (matrix):

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
for row in matrix:
    for num in row:
        print(num, end=' ')
    print()
```

The outer loop goes through rows, and the inner loop goes through numbers in each row.

## VI. Combining with Other Concepts

### (I) Conditional Statements

- We can use `if - else` statements in the `for` loop to do different things based on conditions.

```python
numbers = [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
for number in numbers:
    if number > 0:
        print(f"{number} is positive")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is negative")
```

### (II) Functions

- We can define a function and call it in the `for` loop.

```python
def double(x):
    return 2 * x

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in nums:
    result = double(num)
    print(f"The double of {num} is {result}")
```

## VII. Summary

We now understand the Python `for` loop well. It's a useful tool for handling iterable objects, from simple to complex data structures. It can also work with other programming concepts like conditional statements and functions to write more complex programs.
