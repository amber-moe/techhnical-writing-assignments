# Beginner's Tutorial on For Loops in Python

- ****Objective****

Learn how to use for loops in programming.

- ****What is a for Loop****

A for loop is a way to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times.

- ****Basic Structure****

for (start; condition; increment) {  
    // Code to execute  
}

start: Sets the initial value.

condition: Checks if the loop should continue.

increment: Updates the value after each loop.

- ****Example****

Let's say you want to print the numbers from 1 to 5.

```python
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {  
    System.out.println(i);  
}
```

Explanation:

int i = 1; sets the initial value of i to 1.

i <= 5; is the condition that keeps the loop running as long as i is less than or equal to 5.

i++ increments i by 1 after each loop.

System.out.println(i); prints the current value of i.

- **Steps to create a For Loop**

  1.Declare the Loop Variable:

    Choose a variable name (e.g., i).

    Set its initial value (e.g., int i = 1;).

    2.Set the Condition:

    Determine the condition that will end the loop (e.g., i <= 5;).

    3.Increment the Variable:

     Decide how to update the variable after each loop (e.g., i++).

    4.Write the Code Block:

  Place the code you want to repeat inside the curly braces {}.

- ****Example  Use CAse****

Let's say you want to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10.

```python
int sum = 0;  
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {  
    sum += i;  
}  
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
```

Explanation:

int sum = 0; initializes the sum variable to 0.

The for loop runs from i = 1 to i = 10.

sum += i; adds the current value of i to sum.

After the loop completes, sum will be 55.

****Conclusion****

For loops are a powerful tool for repeating code a fixed number of times. By following the basic structure and steps, you can create your own for loops to solve a variety of problems.
