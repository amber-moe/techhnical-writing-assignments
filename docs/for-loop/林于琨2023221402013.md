# Beginner's Tutorial on For Loops in C++

## 1. Introduction
In the C++ programming language, the `for` loop is a fundamental control flow construct. It empowers developers to execute a specific block of code repeatedly, contingent upon a predefined condition. This looping mechanism is widely utilized, especially when traversing through arrays, vectors, or sequential numerical ranges. By leveraging the `for` loop, programmers can automate repetitive tasks and efficiently process collections of data elements.

## 2.1 Basic Syntax of For Loops
The canonical syntax of a `for` loop in C++ is presented as follows:
```cpp
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to execute
}
```
- **`initialization`**: This segment is executed precisely once, prior to the loop's initiation. For instance, `int i = 0` initializes the loop variable `i` with an initial value of 0.
- **`condition`**: The loop perpetuates its execution as long as this condition evaluates to `true`. For example, `i < 5` would continue the loop while the value of `i` remains less than 5.
- **`increment`**: After each iteration of the loop, this part updates the loop variable. Commonly, `i++` increments the value of `i` by 1.

### 2.1.1 Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << i << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**Output**:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```
In this example, the loop variable `i` is initialized to 0. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than 5. During each iteration, the value of `i` is printed, and then incremented by 1.

## 2.2 Iterating Over an Array
The `for` loop is a staple for iterating over the elements of an array in C++.

### 2.2.1 Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << a[i] << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**Output**:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
