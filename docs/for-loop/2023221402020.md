## Definition of a for Loop

In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. This sequence can be anything that Python can loop over, such as:

1. A list
2. A tuple
3. A string
4. A range of numbers

## Syntax of a for Loop

The basic syntax of a for loop in Python is:
  for variable in sequence:
      # Code block to execute

1. Variable: This is the name of the loop variable. It takes each value in the sequence, one by one.
2. Sequence: This is the collection of items you want to loop through (e.g., a list, string, etc.).
3. The indented code block is executed for each item in the sequence.
