# A Beginner's Tutorial on for Loops in Python

## Definition

In Python, a "for loop" is a control flow statement that allows you to iterate over a sequence and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

## Syntax

for variables in iterables:
    code to be executed

## Usage

To use for loops, follow the steps below:

1. Determine the variables and iterables
2. Write down a for loop sentence
3. Write down the code to be executed

## Examples

1. Iterating over a list

    ```python
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)
    ```

2. Iterating over a string

    ```python
    s = "hello"
    for letter in s:
        print(letter)
    ```

3. Using range()

    ```python
    for i in range(9):
        print(i)
    ```

4. Iterating over a dictionary

    ```python
    person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age':30, 'city':'New York'}
    for key in person:
        print(key)
    ```
