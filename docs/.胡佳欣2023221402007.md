# For loops in Python: A Beginner's Guide

## **1. Introduction to For Loops**

A for loop is a fundamental programming construct that allows you to execute a block of code repeatly for each item in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or sting).

---

## **2. Basic Syntax**

Here’s the basic structure of a for loop in Python:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Do some work here
    
```

- `item`: Each element from your sequence gets stored in this variable every time the loop runs.
- `sequence`: This is what you're looping through, like a list, a range, or even a string of characters.

## **3. Example: Looping Through Numbers**

The classic loop through a range of numbers:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```Python
0
1
2
3
4
```

- `range(5)` gives you numbers 0 to 4.
- Each time through the loop, `i` takes one of those values and runs the code inside.

## **4. Looping Through a List**

You can loop through any list. Take this example:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
for color in colors:
    print(color)
```

Output:

```Python
red
green
blue
```

Every loop grabs an element from the list and stores it in the `color` variable. Then it prints that.

## **5. Looping Through Strings**

You can even loop through characters in a string, like a hacker:

```python
for char in 'Python':
    print(char)
```

Output:

```Python
P
y
t
h
o
n
```

Each character in the string gets printed one by one.

---

## **6. The Range Function**

The `range()` function is your go-to tool for looping through numbers. By default, it starts at 0 and ends just before the number you give it.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

You can also define a starting point:

```python
for i in range(2, 5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```Python
2
3
4
```

---

## **7. Break and Continue**

### **Break**

If you want to bail out of the loop early, use `break`:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

Output:

```Python
0
1
2
```

When `i` equals 3, the loop stops.

### **Continue**

If you want to skip just one iteration of the loop and continue with the rest, use `continue`:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

Output:

```Python
0
1
2
4
```

It skips printing 3 and moves on with the rest.

## **8. Nested Loops**

A loop inside a loop? Here’s how you do it:

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

Output:

```Python
i=0, j=0
i=0, j=1
i=1, j=0
i=1, j=1
i=2, j=0
i=2, j=1
```

You got an outer loop running three times and for each iteration of that, the inner loop runs twice.

## **9. Conclusion**

You’ve made it through, now you know how to use **for loops** like a pro. By mastering `for` loops, you can:

- Iterate through sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.
- Use the `range()` function to generate number sequences.
- Control the flow of your loops with `break` and `continue`.
- Nest loops to handle more complex tasks.
