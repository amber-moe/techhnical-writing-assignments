# For Loop Tutorial for Beginners
## What is a For Loop?
A for loop is a fundamental control structure in programming that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times or over a range of values. It is widely used in scenarios where iteration over a collection of items (like numbers, characters, or elements in a list) is required.
## How to Use a For Loop?
The basic syntax of a for loop can vary slightly depending on the programming language, but the core concept remains the same. Below is a general outline of how a for loop works:
for (initialization; condition; increment) {  
    // Block of code to be executed  
}
Initialization: Sets the initial value before the loop starts.
### Condition: Evaluated before each iteration. If true, the loop continues; if false, the loop terminates.
Increment: Updates the loop variable after each iteration.
### However, in many modern languages like Python, the syntax is more intuitive and does not require explicit initialization, condition checking, and incrementation:
for variable in iterable:  
    # Block of code to be executed
Here, iterable can be a range of numbers, a list, a tuple, a dictionary, or any other iterable object.
# Example in Python
Let's dive into an example to see how a for loop works in Python:
## Example: Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop  
for i in range(1, 6):  # range(1, 6) generates numb ers from 1 to 5 (inclusive of 1, exclusive of 6)  
    print(i)
When you run this code, it will output:
1  
2  
3  
4  
5
In this example:
range(1, 6) generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 5.
i is the loop variable that takes each value from this sequence.
print(i) is the block of code that gets executed for each value of i.
For loops are also extremely useful for iterating over elements in a list. Here's another example to demonstrate this:
## Example: Printing each fruit in a list  
  
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
  
for fruit in fruits:  
    print(fruit)
When you run this code, it will output:
apple  
banana  
cherry
In this example:
fruits is a list of strings.
fruit is the loop variable that takes each value from the fruits list.
print(fruit) prints each fruit to the console.
